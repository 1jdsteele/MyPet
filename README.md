# MyPet
A game where you try to take care of your pet


https://github.com/1jdsteele/MyPet.git


As the user I want to be able to see the pet because it elicits an emotional response.
As I user I want to keep track of my pet's hunger, sleepiness, boredom, and age so I can understand the state of my pet and be able to respond to it.
As a user, I do not want to know some internal details so there is a process of discovery.
As a user I want to be able to interact with my pet to change status conditions so that the interactivity increases.
As a user I want to feel invited to the page so that I want to come back - or at least so I don't want to not come back.
As a user I want to see my pet age so that I can be reminded of my own mortality.
As a user I want to know if my pet dies or gives birth so that I can be disheartened or excited.
As a user I want my pet to change throughout it's life so that I can be reminded of the importance of the fleeting nature of time.
As a user I want my pet to be animated because that is one of the ways in which humans recognize life, giving it a more personal connection to me.
As a user I want to be able to feed my pet to combat hunger because I want to keep it alive.
As a user I want to be able to play a game with my pet to alleviate it's boredom because that simulates life and causes an emotional reaction.
As a user I want to be able to provide an environment where the pet is likely to sleep so that I can prevent it from dying of lack of sleep.


EXTRA
I want my pet to have friends and enemeies so that I can feel that it is socially connected with others, reinforcing this concept of "aliveness."
As a user I want my pet to eventually die of old age because that is a reflection of true life.
I want my pet to escape instead of die when hunger or boredom reaches 10. This is because this is a simulation of real life - if my cats get too hungry or bored, they figure it out for themselves without me. 
I want my pet to go crazy when it's sleepiness goes to 10 because that is what happens in real life.
